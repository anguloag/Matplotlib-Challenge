            <strong>Objective</strong>
            <p>Develop a code using python, pandas, and matplotlib to analyze the results of Pymaceuticals' recent animal study of potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma, and develop summary tables and figures that compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' Capomulin to other treatment regimens.
            </p>

            <strong>Description of the Data: Mouse_metadata and Study_results
            </strong>
            <p>The metadata for all 249 mice included in the study are contained in a csv file called "Mouse_metadata". The dataset is organized into five columns:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mouse ID - the unique ID number for each mouse
                    </li>
                    <li>Drug Regimen - the drug treatment assigned to each mouse (Capomulin, Placebo, or one of 8 other drug regimens)
                    </li>
                    <li>Sex - the sex of each mouse (Male or Female)
                    </li>
                    <li>Age_months - the age of each mouse, measured in months
                    </li>
                    <li>Weight (g) - The weight of each mouse, measured in grams
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The data for the results of the drug trials are contained in a csv file called "Study_results". The dataset is organized into four columns:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mouse ID - the unique ID number for each mouse
                    </li>
                    <li>Timepoint - the timepoint in which the data was taken (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45). Going down the rows, the data is organized chronologically such that all of the results from each timepoint are grouped together going from time 0 to time 45.
                    </li>
                    <li>Tumor Volume (mm3) - the tumor volume for each mouse, measured at each timepoint in cubic millimeters
                    </li>
                    <li>Metastatic Sites - the number of metastative sites for each mouse at each timepoint
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <hr>
            <strong>What the Code Should Do
            </strong>
            <p>The code should merge the data from Mouse_metadata and Study_results into one dataset, and should create the following summary tables (titled and labeled appropriately):
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A Summary Statistics Table, which includes the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error from the mean (SEM) of the tumor volume for each drug treatment
                    </li>
                    <li>Bar Plots that show the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug treatment throughout the course of the study, generated using Pandas DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot
                    </li>
                    <li>Pie Charts the show the percentage of male and female mice included in the study, generated using Pandas DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot
                    </li>
                    <li>A Box and Whisker Plot of the final tumor volumes for the four most promising treatment regimens, which highlights potential outliers by changing their color and style in the plot (generated with Matplotlib)
                    </li>
                    <li>A Line Plot of tumor volume versus time point for one mouse treated with Capomulin
                    </li>
                    <li>A Scatter Plot of tumor volume versus mouse weight for the mice treated with Capamulin, with the linear regression model printed on the plot
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, at least three observations based on the generated charts and tables should be listed at the top of the code notebook.

            <strong>RESULTS: Observations and Insights</strong>
            <p>Based on the results of Pymaceuticals' recent animal study of potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma, some observable trends in treatment effectiveness include the following:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Capomulin and Ramicane had the greatest number of mice still alive by the end of the study.

                    </li>
                    <li>The proportions of female and male mice included in the study were almost equal.
                    <p><img src="https://github.com/anguloag/Matplotlib-Challenge/blob/main/Pymaceuticals/Analysis/Charts/SexofMice_pie_pandas.png?raw=true" alt="pie"/> </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Between Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, Ramicane had the lowest median tumor volume by the end of the study, followed closely by Capomulin.
                    <p><img width=600 src="https://github.com/anguloag/Matplotlib-Challenge/blob/main/Pymaceuticals/Analysis/Charts/FinalTumorVolumebyDrugRegimen_BoxandWhisker.png?raw=true" alt="box and whisker"/> </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Capamulin was shown to be an effective treatment for squamous cell carcinoma, cutting tumor volume by about 50% over the course of the study.
                    <p><img width=600 src="https://github.com/anguloag/Matplotlib-Challenge/blob/main/Pymaceuticals/Analysis/Charts/TumorVolumeofCapomulinMouses185OverTime_line.png?raw=true" alt="line"/> </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>There seemed to be a strong positive correlation (r=.84) between the initial weight of the mice and the average tumor volume over the course of the study. Initial weight may have an impact on the effectiveness of Capomulin on reducing tumor volume.

                    </li>
                </ul>
